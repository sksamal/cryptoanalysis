A couple of notes on this transcript:

1. There are several cuts that are not included in this transcript. The
main ones include: 

     a. various shots that are cut very quickly between the
     cockpit of the Falcon to outside of it.

     b. cuts to commercials are not included. Also, after a
     commercial break the duplicate footage from before the 
     break.

     c.  during the wall screen calls, the cuts between the
     different locations 
 
2. Various word's spellings are approximated.

3. Any corrections, additions, questions, and comments on my sanity for

IF ANYONE CAN HELP WITH THE LYRICS TO THE JEFFERSON STARSHIP SONG, PLEASE
E-MAIL ME! A couple of the lines of this song are just guessed at so,
don't blame me if they are way off. I did my best...

                   THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL

1.   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

     Han and Chewbacca are seated in the cockpit of the Falcon.

2.   EXT. SPACE

     The Falcon speeds across the screen. Two Star Destroyers
     chase the Falcon and fire on her. Several of the laser 
     blasts connect with the shields.

3.   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

     The Falcon rocks as lasers hit their shields.

                            HAN
               That's it I'm turning back.

     Chewie growls at Han in reply.

                            HAN
               I know your family's waiting.

     Chewie growls again.

                            HAN
               I know it's an important day.

     Chewie growls again at Han.

                            HAN
               All right. We'll give it a try. I'll set 
               short coordinates - we won't jump far.

     Han flips some switches on a control panel.

                            HAN
               I'll get you back there in time, pal. 
               Trust me.

     Chewie growls and leans over and pits his arm around Han 
     very affectionately.

4.   EXT. SPACE
 
     A Star Destroyer is firing on the falcon.

5.   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

                            HAN
               Our only hope now, is to outrun that 
               Imperial garbage scow, tho'. I'm going 
               to lightspeed.

     Chewie growls yet again. Han smiles.

                            HAN
               That's the spirit! You'll be celebrating 
               Life Day before you know it! Standby, 
               here's where we say goodbye to our 
               unpleasant friends.

     The Falcon makes the jump to hyperspace.

6.   EXT. SPACE - STARFIELD

     The original graphic of THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL, 
     is brought back up. 

7.   EXT. WOOKIEE HOME - DAY

     Outside shot of Chewbacca's family's home. It is a high 
     in the trees and looks like a cartoonish painting.

8.   INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Malla is busy in the kitchen cleaning or cooking. Itchy is
     sitting in a chair carving X-wings out of wood. Lumpy 
     comes down the steps "flying" one of the X-wings that 
     his grandfather has carved. He then proceeds to "fly" the 
     X-wing around Itchy's head. Itchy growls at Lumpy in 
     anger. Malla makes a reluctant Lumpy leave his Grandfather
     alone and to take out the garbage. On his way over to the
     garbage can, Lumpy sees some cookies on the table and 
     picks one up. Malla sees this and makes him put it back. 
     She then hands him the garbage can he is to take out.
     Lumpy heads to take out the garbage and Malla goes back
     into the kitchen.

9.   EXT. WOOKIEE HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 

     Lumpy exits the door and sets the can next to it. He 
     looks through the railing to the cartoonish ground far 
     below. He then looks back into the house to see if anyone 
     is watching. Apparently, the coast is clear, so, he 
     climbs up on the railing and walks along it like a 
     tightrope walker.

10.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Malla walks over to Itchy and pats him on the shoulder. 
     She then walks over to some shelves and gets a picture 
     frame down with a picture of Chewbacca in it. Itchy walks
     over to her. They exchange some grunts and growls. Malla 
     goes back to the kitchen. Itchy gets a cartridge from a 
     shelf and looks around for Lumpy. Lumpy runs up to him. 
     They head over to a hologram table similar to the chess 
     board on the Falcon. Itchy puts the cartridge in and a
     strange circus of holographic aliens appear. They dance, 
     do acrobatics, and in general caper around. Lumpy is 
     very amused by this and claps at the end of the show. 
     Malla makes Lumpy come over and dry the dishes when its 
     over.

     Malla goes over to a computer console and pushes some 
     buttons on it. Nonsense letter and number combinations 
     come up and then the message: YOU HAVE REACHED TRAFFIC
     CONTROL is displayed. Itchy becomes interested and comes 
     over to Malla. She pushes more buttons and a message 
     saying: NO STARSHIPS IN AREA is displayed. Malla switches 
     off the computer.

     They both then go over to the shelves again and pull 
     aside two panels to reveal a hidden communications 
     monitor. Appearing on the screen is Luke, in his pilot
     uniform, and Artoo working on an engine in a workshop. 
     Luke, who is on his knees, looks up.

                            LUKE
                    (on monitor)
               What's that?
                    (to Artoo)
               Oh, Artoo, look. It's Chewbacca's family.

11.  INT. WORKSHOP

     Chewbacca's family waves at Luke and Artoo from the 
     monitor on Luke's end.

12.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     On the monitor, Luke gives Artoo something.

                            LUKE 
                    (to Artoo)
               Here, keep working on it.

     Luke gets up and walks toward his monitor.

                            LUKE
                    (to wookiees)
               Hello Malla, Itchy. Hiya Lumpy.

     The wookiees wave at Luke through the monitor.

                            LUKE
               Where's Chewbacca?

     All three of them start grunting and growling at the same
     time. Luke holds up his hands, as if to slow them down.

                            LUKE
               Whoa, wait a minute! One at a time.

     Itchy growls at Lumpy and Lumpy walks away mad at him. 
     Malla then "explains" to Luke what is wrong.

                            LUKE
               Yeah...

     Something begins to smoke so Artoo whistles and bumps 
     into Luke's leg. Luke just motions him away without 
     looking at what Artoo wants.

                            LUKE
               Not now, Artoo.

     Malla gets down the picture of Chewbacca off of her shelf 
     and holds it up to her monitor. Artoo beeps more at Luke.
     This time he notices the problem about the smoke.

                            LUKE
               Uh, wait a minute, I don't like the 
               looks of this. Let me get this fixed.

     More smoke pours out of the engine that Luke was working 
     on. He takes a tool to it and adjusts something.

                            LUKE
                    (to Artoo)
               Oh, Artoo, you're supposed to be watching 
               that... There, that ought to hold it. I 
               think.

     He waves the smoke away and makes another adjustment. He 
     then looks up to his monitor.

                            LUKE
                    (to Malla)
               What's up?

     He sees the picture of Chewbacca that Malla is holding.

                            LUKE
               Chewbacca... yeah, well, bring him to the 
               screen. I want to say hello to him.

     The wookiees shake their heads at Luke. They continue 
     their growling.

                            LUKE
               You don't know where he is? ...Oh, he's 
               not there yet. Is that it?

     The wookiees shake their heads in agreement at Luke's 
     answer.

                            LUKE
               Oh boy. Well, all I can tell you is that, 
               uh, he and Han left here on schedule. If 
               he's not there now, they're way overdue. 
               There must've been trouble.

     More smoke comes out of the engine and Artoo beeps at 
     Luke. The wookiees start sounding upset.

                            LUKE
                    (to Artoo)
               Artoo, please, this is important.
                    (to Malla)
               Now, now listen. Calm down. I mean, you 
               know how Han and Chewbacca are - anything 
               could've happened - they could've, they 
               could've stopped off somewhere, or been  
               held up by an asteroid storm. Listen, I 
               wouldn't worry about Chewbacca, I know 
               him and he hasn't missed a Life Day yet, 
               right?

     The wookiees nod in agreement at Luke on their monitor.

                            LUKE
               Well, there you go! He's not going to 
               miss this one either. It's just taking 
               him a little longer to get there, that's 
               all. He'll make it.

     Luke starts to turn away and notices the "sad" expression 
     on Malla's face.

                            LUKE
               Come on, don't look so worried. Now, 
               Chewie's not gonna wanna come home to a 
               house full of long faces, is he? Come on, 
               Malla. Let's see a little smile. Come on...

     Malla finally gives in and smiles for Luke. Luke smiles 
     back at her in response.

                            LUKE
               There, that's better. Try to enjoy your 
               Life Day. I gotta get back to this engine. 
               I think we might have it solved.

     Artoo touches the engine and smoke comes out of it very
     heavily.

                            LUKE
                    (to Artoo)
               OH! ARTOO! What are you doing?! Oh no...

     Artoo beeps at Luke. He looks up and pats Artoo on his 
     dome.

                            LUKE
               It's alright. Nobody's perfect.

     Smoke continues to fill the workshop and the wookiees
     monitor's picture breaks up as the connection is broken. 
     They then close the secret panels to conceal the monitor. 
     Malla walks back over to the console that she used 
     earlier. She pushes more buttons on it and the screen 
     comes to life. First, the screen displays a message 
     saying: SUB TERMINAL 446B. Then, it flashes: STANDBY 
     followed by: CONNECT. The next screen pulls up the 
     message: TRADING POST WOOKIEE PLANET C. This then cuts to 
     a scene of a shop with an Imperial guard looking around 
     at the goods for sale. The owner of the establishment 
     walks into the store and notices the man. The owner is
     Saundan.

                            SAUNDAN
               Hello, an Imperial Guard. I suppose you 
               want to see my identification.

     He reaches into his pocket to pull out his identification.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               No, I'm off duty. I've come to look around 
               your shop.

                            SAUNDAN
               Well, good, good, good. Look around, 
               browse around, make yourself at home... 
               As you can see I've got just about 
               everything a man or wookiee would want.

     The Imperial Guard, who looking around on a table picks
     up a clear bag and examines it.

                            SAUNDAN
               Oh here, let me show you this; I really 
               love this.

     He picks up a small clear box with a dark back on it. He
     blows on it and shines it with his sleeve. He decides that 
     it is not good enough.

                            SAUNDAN
               No...

     He then picks up another and decides it is not good 
     enough either.

                            SAUNDAN
               Uh-uh...

     He then gets one that has a green base and smiles.

                            SAUNDAN
               Ah, here we are. Here it is. A pocket 
               sized aquarium. Wonderful, isn't it?

     He hands the aquarium to the guard who holds it up to 
     show the fish that are inside of it.

                            SAUNDAN
               And, you can take it with you anywhere. 
               And the tank is a snap to clean.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               I hate fish.

     He puts the small tank back on the table and browses some
     more at what is on it.

                            SAUNDAN
               Well, so do I, as a matter of fact. I 
               take a drink once and a while, but I just 
               thought I'd show you some of the stupid 
               stuff those wookiees purchase from me. Oh, 
               here...

     He walks over to a shelf behind them and gets a shoe box 
     sized container from off it.

                            SAUNDAN
               Here's a hot little item that seems to be 
               moving pretty rapidly these days.

     He sets the box on the table and opens it. A warbling 
     buzzer sounds and makes him look up.

                            SAUNDAN
               Excuse me, I got a wall screen customer.

     He turns to the wall screen.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Malla)
               Good to see you again.

     Malla growls and waves to him.

                            SAUNDAN
               Don't worry Malla. I know just why you're 
               calling. You're wondering when that 
               shaggy carpet you ordered will arrive at 
               your home.

     Malla growls in agreement with his assumption.

                            SAUNDAN
               Let me assure you madam, it's on its way. 
               You know, it was made especially for you 
               by a little old woman four planets away. 
               She did it all by herself. In fact, you 
               might say she did it by Han... Solo.

     Malla growls enthusiastically at him.

                            SAUNDAN
               Tho' it's going to take some time to get 
               to you. I know you'll understand.

     He looks back to see if the Imperial Guard is paying
     attention to him.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (under his breath)
               You understand don't you?

     Malla growls agreement.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (normally)
               Terrific! By the way, I'll be by later to 
               drop off that extra proton energy pack.

     Malla waves farewell and growls.

                            SAUNDAN
               You're welcome.

     The call is terminated. Saundan turns back to the Guard 
     who is still browsing around the shop. He then proceeds 
     to pick up the item from the box that he was showing 
     before the wall screen call.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to guard)
               What's a matter? Don't you like this?

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               It's just a groomer.

                            SAUNDAN
               Just a groomer?

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               A groomer..

                            SAUNDAN
               Just a groomer, you say? It's a lot more 
               than that.

     He picks up the manual for the groomer out of its box.

                            SAUNDAN
               Evidently, you haven't read the 
               instructions, the warranty, and the 
               guarantee.
                    (reading from the manual)
               ... besides shaving and hair trimming. 
               It's guaranteed to lift stains off 
               clothing, faces, and hands. Cleans teeth, 
               fingers, and toenails. Washes eyes, 
               pierces ears, calculates, modulates, and
               syncopates like rhythms and can repeat 
               the entire Imperial Code, all 17 volumes, 
               in half the time of the old XP-21. Just 
               the thing to keep you squeaky clean.

     He puts the manual down on the table.

                            SAUNDAN
               I use one of these all the time.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               Really?

     Saundan glances down at himself and notices how unkempt he
     looks.

                            SAUNDAN
               Well, not all the time, but some of the 
               time. Oh, another outstanding, uh, 
               feature of this little model - you can 
               recharge it by simply plugging it into 
               any ordinary laser outlet.

     The Imperial Guard takes the groomer from the Saundan's 
     hands and puts it in his belt.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               I'll take it.

                            SAUNDAN
               Good! I thought you would. Well, would you 
               like to pay me something for it or give me
               something in trade?

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
               I said I'll take it!

     The Imperial Guard turns and leaves the shop with the
     groomer.

                            SAUNDAN
               That's a load off my mind. I thought I 
               might embarrass you when I told you it 
               was a gift.
                    (to himself)
               I don't like embarrassing people. I don't 
               like being embarrassed myself that's why 
               I, uh, don't like to embarrass people. I 
               just said that. ... just a groomer...

13.  EXT. SPACE

     Two Star Destroyers head across the screen.

14.  INT. CORRIDOR

     Darth Vader and an Imperial Officer are walking down a
     corridor.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               We've ordered a blockade and a curfew. And, 
               started a search operation. It's just a 
               matter of time before we find the Rebels.

                            DARTH VADER
               I want the Rebels located and identified. 
               If it means searching every household in 
               the system.
     
15.  EXT. WOOKIEE HOME - DAY

     Again, we are outside the cartoonish tree home of 
     Chewbacca's family. 

16.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME

     Lumpy and Malla are in the kitchen finishing the dishes. 
     Lumpy gets done drying the dishes and hands the towel to 
     his mother. He then waves at her and leaves the kitchen. 
     Malla just shakes her head at him. She then turns on the
     monitor above the counter to a cooking show. A strange
     looking "female" cook, Chef Gormaanda, comes on.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Hello...

     Malla gives a greeting to the Chef Gormaanda.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Today we are going to be preparing a very 
               succulent dish called "Bantha Surprise." 

     Malla heads over to another counter and get a large pot. 
     She brings it over by the monitor.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               It's not only a very hearty, nourishing 
               dish, but it's very economical, too. So 
               all those hungry mouths in your household 
               will be going "yummy yum for their tummy 
               tum." If you just follow along with me as 
               I prepare this popular favorite. 

     Chef Gormaanda picks up a hunk of meat off of her counter.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Now, today I'm going to be using the 
               tenderest cut of the bantha: the loin. 
               The loin is very tasty and serves four 
               nicely. But, of course, if your family 
               has a hearty appetite, I would suggest 
               then that old popular holiday favorite: 
               The Bantha Rump.

     Malla growls in agreement. Chef Gormaanda drops her meat onto 
     the counter with a plop.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Um, very tender. Ah, we just slice into 
               bite-sized pieces.

     Chef Gormaanda uses a small knife to slice up her's. Malla 
     (whose meat is already in front of her) uses a large 
     meat cleaver to "slice" hers.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               And only you know the size of a bite in 
               your family! 

     Chef Gormaanda points her knife at the camera and winks to
     emphasize her point.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Oh! Alright, now it's time to put our 
               chunks into our pots.

     The two put their meat in the respective pots.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Nicely... nicely... Add a dash of negavo. 

     Chef Gormaanda tastes every ingredient she names before putting 
     it in her pot.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Umm, very good. A sprig of celentery. Umm, 
               umm, just a bit of turshum, always nice. 
               And, uh. Um! Turshum is nice! And, just a 
               little whisper of chelchum. Ah, looking 
               very nice.

     Malla growls.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Guess what I forgot? A bit of the 
               calarantrum root! Wonderful! Just adds 
               that touch of piquancy. There we go. 
               Very nice. Um! Now we add enough liquid 
               to cover. 

     They both pour liquid into their pots.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               And guess what we're ready for now: the 
               cooking! Step one - we stir the mixture. 
               Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, 
               stir, stir, stir, stir, very nice. 

     Chef Gormaanda stirs her mixture with every "stir" she says 
     with a spoon. Malla is stirring hers, too.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Now, step two - while we're stirring, we 
               also whip. 

     Chef Gormaanda picks up a whip with her free hand. Malla follows
     suit.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               So it's  stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, 
               whip, stir, stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, 
               whip, stir. Now, let's try it again 
               together at an increased tempo because 
               precision is very important in this 
               recipe and we do want a fine consistency, 
               don't we? So, and on the count of one - 
               stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir, 
               stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir. 
               Come on, faster altogether now. Cooking 
               can be fun. 
                    (faster)
               Stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir, 
               stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir. 
               Wah! Having fun, having fun, alright. 
               Having it all nicely, now. Step three - 
               we also have to beat. 

     A "third" hand comes from behind Chef Gormaanda and picks up a
     mallet. It places it in the pot.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               So it's: beat, beat, beat, stir, whip, 
               stir, whip, beat, beat, stir. That's not 
               right. I'm sorry. Stir, whip, stir, whip, 
               whip, whip, stir, beat, stir, whip, stir, 
               whip, whip, whip, stir, beat. A ha ha,ha 
               ha ha, huh huh huh, huh huh huh. Coming... 
               coming along nicely. Mmmm, starting to 
               have a fine aroma.

     Chef Gormaanda starts to sneeze. A "fourth" hand appears from
     behind the cook. The hand puts a finger to her nose to 
     stop the sneeze.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Whew, caught it just in time. Now at this 
               time, I usually like to taste the broth. 
               So, we'll have a little taste and see how 
               it's coming along. 

     The fourth hand picks up a ladle and dips it in the pot 
     to get some broth. Chef Gormaanda tastes it. Malla just picks up 
     her whole pot and tastes it from there.

                           CHEF GORMAANDA
               Mmmm, a little bit more turshum. A bit 
               negavo. A little tunkell. One for the pot, 
               um! Coming along very nice. Mmm! Oh, 
               wonderful! Coming along nicely...

     Malla gets frustrated with keeping up with Chef Gormaanda and 
     shuts off her monitor. She takes her pot and puts it on 
     the floor.

17.  EXT. SPACE

     Several TIE fighters are attacking the Falcon. The ships
     exchange fire and one of the TIEs are destroyed.

18.  INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

     Chewie puts his arm around Han and growls. Han smiles at
     Chewie in return. Chewie growls again as the cockpit is
     rocked from laser blasts.

                            HAN
               Alright. Alright, the coordinates weren't 
               the best.

     Chewie growls in agreement to Han's statement.

                            HAN
               Out of the frying pan into the fryer, huh 
               pal? How should I know we'd come outta 
               hyperspace into the middle of an Imperial 
               convoy. At least against these fighters 
               we got more of a chance. However slim...

     Chewie growls something to Han.

                            HAN 
               You can say that again. This is one Life 
               Day we won't soon forget. Wait, I lost 
               control of the remote cannons.

     Chewie growls.

                            HAN
               I'm gonna hafta run back and operate the 
               aft gun manually. Stay on things here. 
               Why do I always think that taking you 
               home for Life Day's gonna be easy?

     Chewie just growls back at Han.

19.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Malla is standing near their shelves staring at the 
     picture of Chewie that she is holding. Itchy is sleeping 
     in a chair. A loud buzzer sounds and wakes him up. The 
     two look around in alarm, not knowing what it means. The 
     wall screen comes on and an Imperial Officer appears on 
     it.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Attention all viewers.

     Malla and Itchy walk over to the screen to see what is the
     problem.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Due to suspected Rebel activity on the 
               Kashyyyk planet, the Empire has declared 
               martial law. A blockade has been set up 
               around the planet. No ships will be 
               permitted to land or take off until 
               further notice.

     A knock is heard at the door. Malla takes Lumpy towards 
     the kitchen and Itchy goes to answer the door. He growls 
     to see who is at the door.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (off screen)
               It's me Saundan.

     Itchy opens the door and lets him in. Saundan is carrying 
     a bag with a box in it in one hand and something that 
     looks like a "boom box" in the other. Both have bows on 
     them.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (on screen)
               Hi, Itchy. I brought you that proton pack. 
               You know, for the, uh, the whatsis, the
               whatchamalcalit, the, the thingamabob, 
               the mind evaporator. That's it, the mind
               evaporator. Boy am I glad to see you 
               folks. How are my favorite wookiees today? 
               Why all the long hairy faces? I made it 
               through the Imperial patrol, didn't I? If 
               I made it, Chewie and Han will. Is this 
               all the big hello I get? 

     Lumpy runs up to him and gives him a hug. Saundan takes 
     the box out of the bag and hands it to Lumpy.

                            SAUNDAN
               I brought you somethin' special short 
               stuff. You want it? You got it. Happy Life 
               Day. I love to make a wookiee happy. 

     Lumpy takes the box and runs upstairs.

                            SAUNDAN
               And now, for the lovely lady of the house. 

     He picks up the "boom box."

                            SAUNDAN
               Happy Life Day. 

     Malla starts to take the box from him but Saundan holds on 
     to it.

                            SAUNDAN
               Now wait a, wait a minute, not so fast.
               What does an old friend get? Well? 

     Malla gives him a kiss on the cheek and he gives her the 
     box.

                            SAUNDAN
               That's more like it.

20.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     Lumpy runs up into his bedroom. There are toys scattered 
     all over, including a stuffed bantha. He sits the box on 
     the floor and opens it. Inside is some kind of electronic 
     do-it-yourself kit. Lumpy pulls it out and dumps all the
     parts on his floor.

21.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Itchy)
               Itchy, I know what you'd like. 

     Itchy and Saundan walk over to the mind evaporator. It is 
     a chair with a helmet and visor. Itchy sits in the chair.

                            SAUNDAN
               I'll insert this proton pack. 

     Saundan inserts the proton pack into the back of the chair.

                            SAUNDAN
               Now then Itchy, I thought you might like 
               this. It's one of those uh... oh, it's a 
               real... it's kinda hard to explain... WOW, 
               if you know what I mean. 
                    (to himself)
               Put that right in there.

     He places a small cartridge in the arm of the chair.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Itchy)
               Happy Life Day. And I do mean happy Life 
               Day.

     The program starts. It is a swirling kaleidoscope of light.
     Several beings swim through the designs. 

                            WOMAN
                    (voice only)
               I know you're searching for me. Searching,
               searching... I'm here. My voice is for you 
               alone. 

     A blurry image of a woman appears in the middle of the
     swirling.

                            WOMAN
               I am found in your eyes only. I exist for 
               you alone. I am in your mind as you create 
               me. Oh, yes... I can feel my creation.

     A woman with pink stringy hair comes completely in focus. 
     She giggles. 

                            WOMAN
                    (on monitor)
               I'm getting your message. Are you getting 
               mine?

     Itchy growls a happy affirmative.

                            WOMAN
               Oh, oh... We are excited, aren't we? Well, 
               just relax. Just relax. Yes, a little more. 
               Now, we can have a good time, can't we? 
               I'll tell you a secret, I find you 
               adorable.

     Itchy hits the repeat button.

                            WOMAN
               I'll tell you a secret, I find you 
               adorable.

     Itchy hits the repeat button again.

                            WOMAN
               I find you adorable.

     Itchy hits the repeat button one more time.

                            WOMAN
               I find you adorable.

     Itchy growls.

                            WOMAN
               I don't need to ask how you find me.
                    (with echo)
               You see, I am your fantasy. I am your 
               experience. So experience me. I am your 
               pleasure. Enjoy me. This is our moment 
               together in time that we might turn this 
               moment into an eternity.

     Music starts to play.

                            WOMAN
                    (singing)
               If we could only bend this minute. 
               Infinitely extend this minute. Then I 
               could live my whole life right now. 
               Reality is sweet this minute. Can't we 
               repeat and repeat this minute? Why can't 
               it always be right now? I've parted with 
               yesterday. Yesterday's moment is cold. All 
               I ask is this moment to hold. How can we 
               ever lose this minute? From all my life, I 
               choose this minute. I will give up the old 
               and the new. Sharing with you this minute 
               now. If I could just hold my breath and 
               close my eyes and not make a sound. Will 
               the universe stop going 'round? Still the 
               universe keeps going 'round and 'round and 
               on and on and on and on and on. A minute's 
               almost gone. How can we ever, ever lose 
               this minute? From all my life, I choose 
               this minute. I will never need anything 
               more than living for this minute now. This 
               minute now. This minute now. This minute 
               now. This minute now. This minute now. 
               This minute now. This minute now. This 
               minute now. This minute now.

     The program ends with the woman fading into the swirling
     that it started with.

22.  INT. REBEL OFFICE

     Threepio is trying to make a connection on the 
     communications device. Leia is behind a desk working on
     something. Malla answers at her end of the line.
 
                            THREEPIO
                    (to Leia)
               Ah, I have made the connection. You may 
               speak now, if you wish.

     Leia gets up from he desk and walks over to the monitor.

                            LEIA
               Malla, it's good to see you. Happy Life 
               Day.

     Malla growls.

                            THREEPIO
                    (translating)
               Oh, she says it may be a happy Life Day 
               for you, but personally, she's seen 
               happier ones.

                            LEIA
                    (to Threepio)
               I... I don't want to tie up the channels. 
                    (to Malla)
               So, could you do me a favor and send 
               either Chewbacca or Han Solo to the 
               screen please?

     Malla growls and shakes he head "no.".

                            THREEPIO
                    (translating)
               She says that she would like to grant your 
               request, but is quite unable to do so.

                            LEIA
                    (to Malla)
               You mean they haven't arrived yet?

     Malla growls.

                            THREEPIO
                    (translating)
               She says, there has been no contact.

                            LEIA
                    (to Threepio)
               Yes, I think I understand her message. Oh, 
               that Imperial patrol must be giving them 
               more trouble than we bargained for. Oh...
                    (to Malla)
               Malla, are, are you alone?

     Malla growls that she isn't.

                            THREEPIO
                    (to Leia)
               If, you would permit me.
                    (translating)
               No, she says she is not alone. She's with 
               a friend.

                            LEIA
                    (to Malla)
               Could he come to the screen, please?

     Malla growls and motions for Saundan to come over to the
     monitor. He does as she says.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Leia)
               Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Saundan, a local 
               trader. A friend of the rebellion and a 
               member of the Alliance.

                            LEIA
                    (to Saundan)
               Good. Look, I know I can count on you to 
               take care of my friends until their leader 
               returns. You'll do that for me, won't you?

                            SAUNDAN
               Yes indeed, ma'am. That's what I'm here 
               for.

     Malla growls and puts her arm around Saundan very
     affectionately.

                            THREEPIO
                    (translating)
               She is expressing her warmth towards the 
               trader.

     Leia is slightly amused by Threepio's need to translate 
     that and smiles.

                            LEIA
                    (to Malla)
               Look, I can see you're in good hands, 
               Malla. I'll contact you again, soon.

     The call ends.

23.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Malla)
               Now then, what's that I smell? Oh, could 
               it be some of those famous wookiee 
               ookiees?

     Malla shakes her head "yes" and they head towards the 
     kitchen. They also leave open the panels that conceal 
     their secret communications monitor.

24.  INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

     Chewie growls at Han.

                            HAN
               I told you we'd make it. Did I ever let 
               you down?

     Chewie growls affectionately at Han.

                            HAN
               I feel the same way about you too, pal. 
               And your family.

                            HAN
               I've never seen so much Imperial traffic 
               in this system. 

     A display is shown of the Imperial traffic to show Han's
     point.

                            HAN
               Better land on the north side. It'll be 
               safer there.

     Chewie growls.

                            HAN
               So, it's a long walk. A little exercise 
               never hurt anybody. 

27.  EXT. SPACE AROUND KASHYYYK

     The Falcon is just about to enter the atmosphere of the
     planet.

28.  INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

                            HAN
               Happy Life Day, pal.

30.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     Lumpy looks up at the sound of a ship flying overhead. He
     becomes very excited.

31.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Malla and Saundan are seated at the table as they hear the
     sound of the ship. The stand up excitedly.

                            SAUNDAN
               Sounds like a starship. What I tell ya? 
               Must be Chewbacca now!

     Malla growls happily at his announcement.

32.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     Lumpy runs towards the stairs and heads down.

33.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Malla and Lumpy meet at the door and open it only to be
     greeted by two stormtroopers with blasters pointed at 
     them. The stormtroopers enter, followed by an Imperial 
     guard and an Imperial officer. Saundan walk quietly over 
     to the secret communications monitor and closes the 
     panels to conceal it. The Imperial guard walks up to the
     officer with some device in his hand.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
                    (to officer)
               This unit is occupied by four wookiees. 
               Two adult males, one adult female, and 
               one male child.

     The officer snaps his fingers and dismisses the Imperial
     guard. He then walks over to where the huddled group of
     wookiees and Saundan are gathered.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to Malla)
               Where is the other wookiee male?

     Malla just growls and Saundan walks over to the Imperial
     Officer.

                            SAUNDAN
               Officer, uh, maybe I could be of some help 
               there, sir.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to Saundan)
               Who are you and what are you doing in this 
               wookiee house?

                            SAUNDAN
               Oh, I'm a trader in this district. You see, 
               the uh, uh the truth of the matter is she 
               had a terrible fight with her husband and 
               he just stormed right out.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Your identification.

                            SAUNDAN
               Uh...

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (yelling)
               I said it!
                    (normally)
               Your identification.

                            SAUNDAN
               Oh, identification, yes. It's a very 
               important thing, identification. I, I 
               never leave the shop without my 
               identification. It's uh, it's very 
               important, just in times like this. 

     The Imperial officer gets the pad from the guard and 
     snaps his fingers at a stormtrooper. The stormtrooper 
     points his blaster in Saundan's face.

                            SAUNDAN
               I just found my identification. I think 
               it's in my pocket.

     He pull his identification out of his pocket and hands it 
     to the Imperial officer.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to his troops)
               Search the dwelling.

     The officer snaps his fingers to signal his men. They 
     begin to spread out and search the house.

                            SAUNDAN
               Officer, you may notice that little 
               leather case that I carry my 
               identification card in. I whipped that up 
               myself. That's a pretty fast selling little item.

     Saundan laughs nervously.

                            SAUNDAN
               Uh... uh well, some people like to keep 
               things neat and clean and that's why uh, 
               I have the little leather case for the
               identification card. As a matter of fact, 
               if any of you guys want a couple of those 
               leather cases. I've gotta couple of extra 
               ones here. 

     One of the stormtroopers pulls open one of the panels 
     that conceal the communications monitor. He doesn't 
     notice that the other panel opens and closes it. Saundan, 
     who was watching this, is very relieved.

                            SAUNDAN
               Oh, officer, that uh, that picture you're 
               looking at right now was taken quite a 
               few years ago. That's uh, one of me. I've 
               gained quite a bit of weight since then. 

     Saundan laughs nervously again. The Imperial guard kneels 
     down in front of Lumpy

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
                    (to Lumpy)
               Hello little guy. Where's your daddy?

     Lumpy snaps at the Imperial guard.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
                    (angrily)
               Hey, they have no respect for authority!

     The guard pulls his arm back to strike Lumpy. Malla steps
     forward and growls angrily at him. Saundan steps between 
     them and separates them.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to guard)
               Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Uh, maybe 
               you know my brother's boy. He's a member 
               of the Imperial militia. He must be 24 or 
               25 years old by know. Good little guy...

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to Saundan)
               Your identification is in order. You can 
               go now.

     The officer walks over to Saundan and gives him back his
     identification.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to officer)
               Thank you, thank you very much. I just 
               have a little more work to finish up here 
               and uh, oh by the way, uh, while I'm 
               finishing up here uh, why don't you boys 
               uh, take it easy. Relax. Put your feet up 
               and make yourself at home. Wookiee food 
               isn't the greatest but I'm sure I can 
               whip something up in the kitchen that we 
               can all eat.
                    (to Malla)
               Uh, you don't mind do ya, Malla?

     Malla growls something back at Saundan.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (forcefully)
               Malla will you come in the kitchen to 
               help me.

     Malla goes to the table to get her "boom box" on the way 
     to the kitchen. The guard pulls it away from her and 
     examines it. Malla howls in anger.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to guard)
               What are doing with that thing? That's a 
               very delicate piece of workmanship.

     Saundan goes to Malla and comforts her. The guard puts the
     machine back on the table.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Malla)
               Alright Malla, it's alright.
                    (to guard)
               The slightest jarring will mess up the 
               whole works. If you're going to play 
               around with it let me show you how.

     He reaches towards the machine and a stormtrooper pulls 
     his blaster and puts it in his face.
                            SAUNDAN
               Relax, I gotta turn it on, don't I? 

     The guard motions for the stormtrooper to put his blaster 
     up. The stormtrooper complies.

                            SAUNDAN
               Just sit down and enjoy it, okay?

     Saundan pulls a chair out for the guard. The guard sits 
     down in it.
 
                            SAUNDAN
               Here we go.   

     Saundan opens the front of the box which folds down. He 
     fools around needlessly with it. He then "sees" a bug and
     claps it in his hands. He then drops it to the floor and
     stomps on it. This is too much for the guard. He stands 
     up and yells at Saundan.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
                    (angrily)
               Will you get on with it?

                            SAUNDAN
               Okay, okay.

     Saundan pushes one button on it and walks away. The box 
     starts to produce music and the guard sits back down in 
     front of it. With the beat of it a small pink light 
     flashes. A band slowly starts to appear.

                            SINGER
               God, all dignified, if you want to. What 
               I would really like to know. Will you 
               light the sky on fire? Will you light 
               tonight like you did the night before? 
               Hey! You could take me higher than the 
               diamonds in the sky. Take me, light in 
               the sky and we'll vanish without a trace 
               and we'll see God then. Temples and 
               mirrors interest me. Though all there 
               really is to know. Will you light the sky 
               on fire? Will you light the sky on fire 
               again tonight? You can take me higher 
               than the diamonds in the sky. Take me, 
               we'll vanish without a trace and then 
               we'll all see God then. On the pyramids of 
               the legend. The great god Kopa Khan came 
               from the stars and vanished. And the 
               legends say he will come back again 
               someday, someday... Will you light the 
               sky on fire? Will you light tonight like 
               you did the night before. You can take me 
               higher than the diamonds in the sky. Take 
               me, light in the sky and we'll vanish 
               without a trace, And then we'll see god 
               then. Yes, I would really like to know. 
               What I've been watching this for. Yes, I 
               would really like to know. Will you light 
               the sky on fire? Will you light the sky 
               like you did the night before? You could 
               take me higher than the diamonds in the 
               sky. Take me, we'll vanish without a 
               trace. And we'll all see God then. Vanish 
               without a trace. Vanish without a trace. 
               Come on, come on, come on, come on, come 
               on, let's vanish without a trace. Come on, 
               come on, come on, come on, come on, we'll 
               vanish without a trace.

     As the music ends the band slowly disappears only to 
     leave the pulsating pink light. When the music comes to 
     an end the light stops. Saundan walks back over to the 
     guard.

                            SAUNDAN
               I knew you'd like it.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Your work here is finished. You may leave 
               now.

                            SAUNDAN
               I guess you're right. It's about all I 
               can do for now. I hope you guys find what 
               you're looking for. Keep up the good work.

     Saundan turns to go and stops where the wookiees are 
     huddled.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Malla)
               Malla.
                    (to Itchy)
               Itchy, please...

     Itchy hands him the bag that he brought Lumpy's gift in
     earlier.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Alright, finish the search of the 
               residence.

     The Imperial officer snaps his fingers at his troops. 
     Saundan who is just about gone turns back into the house.

                            SAUNDAN
               Oh, I almost forgot. I want to leave you 
               my card in case you need any of uh, oh...

     A stormtrooper stops him with his blaster pointed at his
     face. Saundan turns to leave again.
 
                            SAUNDAN
               Okay, I'm leaving.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Investigate the upper area. Check for 
               any Rebel material. Anything to connect 
               this household with the Alliance.

     Saundan again heads back into the house.

                            SAUNDAN
               Oh, don't forget about those protective 
               cases for your identification card. I 
               gotta good item... 

     The stormtrooper again stops Saundan with his blaster.

                            SAUNDAN
               That's it, I'm gone.

     Saundan finally leaves.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Finish the search of the house. We have 
               other areas to cover today.

     The officer points his hand in a stormtrooper's face.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to stormtrooper)
               You! Take the upper area.

     Lumpy tries to stop the stormtrooper from going upstairs 
     but is violently pushed aside by him. Malla jumps to her
     son's aid only to be stopped by the other stormtrooper's
     blaster in her face. The officer pushes the blaster away 
     from Malla.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh... We don't want 
               to have to hurt anyone. That's not what 
               we're here for.

     The officer snaps his fingers at the stormtrooper to 
     dismiss him. The stormtrooper walks away.
 
                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               But, when my men get angry I can't always 
               control them. We are going to continue 
               our search. Now keep him quiet and I'll 
               forget this ever happened.

     Malla takes Lumpy over to a table and chair. There is a 
     small yellow box and pair of headphones on it. Lumpy sits
     down and puts on the headphones. He then presses a button.
     Strange lettering appear on the small screen. Lumpy looks
     around to see if anyone is watching him. He sees a
     stormtrooper and a guard going up the staircase. Lumpy 
     pushes a button on the box and a cartoon starts on the
     screen.

34.  EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

     The camera goes through an asteroid field until it comes 
     to a stop on a Rebel base. A large portal is in the side 
     of the station. Through it is seen a bustle of activity 
     going on inside. 

                            CAPTAIN KAZAN
                    (voice over)
               Starlog 3-24-1 from the bridge of the 
               cruiser RS Reekvange, captain Kazan 
               reporting. We are awaiting the return of 
               captain Han Solo and his first mate, 
               Chewbacca. Who are long overdue on a 
               delicate mission to acquire the mystical 
               talisman, which has been sought by our 
               forces and the Empire.

35.  INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM

     Luke, Leia, C-3PO, and Rebel General are looking out the
     portal into the asteroid field. Artoo rolls down a ramp 
     and whistles at Threepio.

                            THREEPIO
                    (to Artoo)
               The talisman - it makes things invisible, 
               I think.

     Artoo beeps another question.

                            THREEPIO
               Yes, even you. Which I think might be an
               improvement.

     A red colored alien with a headset is sitting at a
     communications console. He is a communications officer. 
     On the monitor, a blip is headed towards their base in 
     the asteroid field.

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
               We've picked up something.

                            LUKE
               It's the Millennium Falcon.

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
               They're coming out of lightspeed. I can't 
               make contact.

                            REBEL GENERAL
               Try a lower channel.

     The radar display fades and a view of the cockpit of the
     Falcon is shown. Chewie is seated and Han can be seen 
     hanging upside down in the background.

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                    (into headset)
               Falcon, do you copy? Come in Falcon.

                            LUKE
               It's Chewie. But where's Han?

                            LEIA
               That's him! Hanging upside down!

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                    (to Rebel General)
               I can't make radio contact.

                            REBEL GENERAL
               He's on a collision course. Princess, 
               we're in mortal danger from our own 
               forces.

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                    (into headset)
               Falcon, do you copy?

                            REBEL GENERAL
               This is madness.

                            LUKE
               You're right General. I can't understand 
               what Chewbacca's doing.

                            LEIA
               Whatever he's doing, there must be a 
               reason. Hold your fire.

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                    (to Rebel General)
               We've lost all contact, sir.

     The monitor with Chewie on it goes to static.

36.  EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

     The Falcon is headed straight for the Rebel base.

                            REBEL GENERAL
                    (voice over)
               Standby. The Falcon is near impact.

     The Falcon changes direction at the last minute and 
     speeds away from the base.

37.  INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM

                            LUKE
               I'm going after them.

                            LEIA
               Luke, take Artoo with you.

     Artoo whistles.

                            LUKE
                    (to Threepio)
               What'd he say?

                            THREEPIO
               If something has happened to captain Solo 
               and Chewbacca is alone, you will need me 
               to interpret.

38.  EXT. SPACE

     A Y-wing flies through the asteroid filed and follows the
     Falcon. The Falcon fires several shots at the Y-wing but
     miss.

39.  INT. Y-WING - COCKPIT

     Luke and Threepio are both seated in the cockpit. Laser 
     blasts flash past the canopy of the fighter.

                            THREEPIO
               Sir, he's firing on us.

                            LUKE
               I know, but I don't think he means to hit 
               us. Chewie's a better shot than that.

40.  EXT. SPACE

     The Falcon accelerates and speeds away from the pursuing 
     Y-wing.

                            THREEPIO
                    (voice over)
               Look, he's speeding up. We're losing him.

                            LUKE
                    (voice over)
               Not for long.

41.  INT. Y-WING - COCKPIT

     Luke holds his headset microphone closer to his mouth and
     speaks into it.

                            LUKE
                    (into headset)
               This is Y-4 to base. He's heading 
               straight for a moon in the Panos system.

42.  EXT. MOON - OCEAN - DAY

     The Falcon flies into a red jelly-like ocean. It goes 
     under the surface and pops back up on balloons.

43.  EXT. SPACE

     The Y-wing is headed for the same moon that the Falcon 
     landed on. The Y-wing is shaking from entering the moon's
     atmosphere.
   
                            LUKE
                    (voice over)
               Hang on Artoo.

44.  INT. Y-WING COCKPIT

     The cockpit of the ship is shaking violently.

                            THREEPIO
               What about me? I'm going to shake apart!

45.  INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM

     Leia and the communications officer are at the comm unit.
     Luke's transmissions are being monitored by them.

                            LUKE
                    (over speaker)
               We're approaching the water planet. We're 
               following Han and Chewie...

     The message is cut off by static.

                            COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
               We've lost them.

46.  EXT. MOON - OCEAN - DAY

     The Y-wing is headed for the ocean.

                            LUKE
               Hang on, Threepio. We're going in.

                            THREEPIO
               Are you sure this is the best way, sir?

     The Y-wing bounces on the surface of the water several 
     times before coming to a rest. Artoo whistles and 
     balloons inflate to keep the ship above water.

47.  INT. Y-WING - COCKPIT

     Threepio is in the back seat upside down. Luke who wound 
     up under the dashboard, sits up.

                            THREEPIO
               Master Luke, sir, are you all right?

                            LUKE
               Yes. How 'bout Artoo?

     Artoo whistles that he is. Luke pushes a button on the
     dashboard and it beeps.

                            LUKE
               Our comlinks are out. We can't contact the 
               base.

48.  EXT. MOON - OCEAN - DAY

     The Y-wing is floating on the ocean. The cockpit hatch 
     opens.

                            THREEPIO
               Where are you going, sir?

     Luke stands up and looks around with his macrobinoculars.

                            LUKE
               To see if I can locate the Falcon by 
               visual sighting. Maybe it's close by.

     A large creature has risen up from the water behind the 
     Y-wing and roars. Luke drops his macrobinoculars and 
     pulls out his blaster. He fires on the creature and hits 
     it in the head. The creature just licks his licks as if 
     it liked being shot.
 
                            LUKE
                    (to Artoo)
               Artoo, stand by to fire the ejection pod.

     The creature reaches its long neck down and takes a bite 
     out of the rear of the ship.

                            THREEPIO
               And hurry Artoo or we'll be desert soon.

     The front of the ship detaches and speeds away. The 
     creature is hit by a ray that makes it dive into the 
     ocean. The ray came from a forked rifle held by Boba Fett. 
     He is seated in a saddle on another of the creatures.

                            THREEPIO
               What is it, master Luke?

                            LUKE
               I'm not sure.
                    (to Boba)
               You saved my life. Thank you.

                            BOBA FETT
               You are alone?

                            LUKE
               I have two droids. We've come in search 
               of a ship that crashed near here.

                            BOBA FETT
               Maybe I can help you. I am Boba Fett. The 
               ship you seek is nearby.

                            LUKE
               Are the Imperial troops near this planet?

                            BOBA FETT
               They are here, friend and growing more 
               powerful.

                            LUKE
               How far away?

     The creature that Boba is riding licks what remains of 
     Luke's Y-wing. Boba smacks the creature with his rifle.

                            BOBA FETT
                    (to creature)
               Settle down.
                    (to Luke)
               All they do is eat.

               Luke pulls out a ration pack.

                            LUKE
               This is all we have but uh, he's welcome 
               to it.

     The creature wraps it tongue around the pack and pulls it 
     out of Luke's hands and into its mouth. It chews it and 
     then swallows.

                            BOBA FETT
               You are foolish to waste your kindness on 
               this dumb creature. No lower life form is 
               worth going hungry for, friend. I take it 
               you have no love of the Empire.

                            LUKE
               I don't.

                            BOBA FETT
               Well, neither do I. It will be easy to 
               find the ship you seek. Follow me, 
               friend.

     He hits his mount with his rifle and the creature begins 
     to move.

49.  INT. Y-WING - COCKPIT

                            THREEPIO
               Don't you think it might be imprudent to 
               trust him so quickly, sir?

                            LUKE
               He's our only chance. And, besides he 
               seems like a friend.

     Artoo beeps.

                            THREEPIO
               Indeed, friend is merely a term that is 
               often misused.

50.  EXT. MOON - OCEAN - DAY

     Luke's Y-wing follows Boba Fett across the ocean. Several
     moons can be seen in the sky.

                            LUKE
                    (voice over)
               Did Artoo say that?

                            THREEPIO
               Words to that affect.

     We then see the Millennium Falcon floating on its 
     balloons.

51.  INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

     Chewie is holding the glowing talisman in his hands. Luke 
     is standing a doorway.

                            LUKE
               Chewie, you've got the talisman. What's 
               wrong?

     Chewie growls.

                            LUKE
               No, don't destroy it! 

     Chewie drops the talisman out of a porthole. Luke glows 
     and then slumps to the floor.

                            LUKE
               The talisman...

     Boba sees Luke on the ground and fires a rope from his 
     wrist at Chewie. The rope wraps itself around Chewie.

                            THREEPIO
               Boba Fett, no! He's a friend. Don't hurt 
               him, Boba Fett.

                            BOBA FETT
               What did he do to Luke?

     Boba releases the rope that is holding Chewie. Artoo
     whistles.

                            THREEPIO
               He didn't do anything. R2-D2 has detected
               contamination. 

     Chewie picks up Luke and carries him down a corridor. 
     Everyone follows him.

                            THREEPIO
               It must have come from the talisman.

     Artoo whistles.

                            THREEPIO
               Artoo says it's some kind of sleeping 
               virus that only affects humans.

     Chewie growls and then hangs Luke upside down next to Han.

                            THREEPIO
               He says the only way to keep them alive is 
               to let the blood rush to their heads.

                            BOBA FETT
               I know this sleeping virus the Empire 
               uses on its enemies. They have a remedy 
               for it in the city. I could get some for 
               you.

     Chewie growls.

                            THREEPIO
               I'm afraid, Chewbacca insists on going 
               with you.

                            BOBA FETT
               You'll only get in the way. But, if you 
               must. Come on.

52.  EXT. MOON - OCEAN NEAR CITY - DAY

     Chewie and Boba ride his creature towards the city. When 
     they arrive, they climb up into the city through a duct.

53.  EXT. CITY - STREET - DAY

     Boba Fett and Chewie are standing in a doorway of a 
     building. There are many aliens around - either walking 
     or standing.

                            BOBA FETT
               You stay here while I get the serum.

     Chewie growls.

                            BOBA FETT
               I said stay, friend. Luke trusted me and 
               I'm your only chance of getting out of 
               here alive. Do you understand me?

     Chewie growls that he does. Boba walks away from Chewie 
     and walks the streets past many exotic aliens. He sees a 
     shop with a sign advertising the serum.

                            CAPTAIN KAZAN
                    (voice over)
               Starlog update: although Boba Fett 
               quickly located the serum for the 
               sleeping virus - we had no idea of his 
               real plan.

     Boba goes to a public communications unit and inserts a 
     card into it. Darth Vader appears on the monitor.

                            BOBA FETT
               I have made contact with the Rebels and 
               all is proceeding as you wish, Darth 
               Vader.

54.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     At this revelation, Lumpy has a fit and starts howling. 
     The Imperial officer hears him howling and walks over to 
     him. Lumpy quickly pushes a button on the yellow box and 
     a game comes up.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               What is it now? Oh is that all, just some 
               silly game.

     Lumpy shakes his head "yes." The officer walks away and
     leaves him alone. Lumpy pushes another button and the 
     cartoon comes back on.

55.  INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

     Threepio is checking Han and Luke with a strange device.

                            THREEPIO
               Yes, their metabolisms are slowing down. 
               I wonder what's keeping Chewbacca. Try to 
               find them on the viewscreen.

     Artoo plugs his "arm" into the viewscreen controls. Darth
     Vader appears on the monitor. 

                            THREEPIO
               Darth Vader!

                            DARTH VADER
                    (on monitor)
               Good work, but I want them alive. Now that 
               you've got their trust, they may take you 
               to their new base.

     The viewscreen switches from Darth to Boba.

                            BOBA FETT
                    (on monitor)
               This time we'll get them all.

     The viewscreen switches back to Darth.

                            DARTH VADER
                    (on monitor)
               I see why they call you the best bounty 
               hunter in the galaxy.

                            THREEPIO
               Oh no! What will we do now?

56.  EXT. CITY - STREET - DAY

     A group of stormtroopers march by where Chewie is still
     hiding in the doorway. Boba Fett returns.

                            BOBA FETT
               I have the serum.

     Chewie sniffs the air as if he smells something. 

                            BOBA FETT
               We must leave quickly, friend.

57.  EXT. MOON - OCEAN - DAY

     Boba Fett and Chewie flee the city on the creature. They 
     are followed by an Imperial gun boat manned by 
     stormtroopers. The boat fires on the creature carrying 
     Boba and Chewie and miss. Boba pulls out his blaster and 
     fires on the boat. He misses. Chewie takes the blaster 
     out of his hand and fires on the boat. He hits it and it
     explodes.

58.  INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

     Han and Luke are both untied and conscious. They are 
     still groggy from the sleeping virus.

                            BOBA FETT
               Are you all right?

                            LUKE
               I'm not sure.

                            HAN 
               What happened?

                            LUKE
               I don't know.

                            HAN
               Well, somebody must know something.

     Chewie growls.

                            HAN
               He says our friend Boba found serum for 
               the talisman virus.

                            LUKE
               Boba, you're a hero and a faithful friend. 
               You must come back with us.

     Artoo goes nuts.

                            LUKE
                    (to Threepio)
               What's the matter with Artoo?

                            THREEPIO
               I'm afraid, sir, it's because you said 
               Boba is a friend and faithful ally. That 
               simply does not feed properly into 
               Artoo's information bank.

                            LUKE
               What are you talking about?

                            THREEPIO
               We intercepted a message between Boba and 
               Darth Vader, sir. Boba Fett is Darth 
               Vader's right hand man. I'm afraid this 
               whole adventure has been an Imperial plot.

                            BOBA FETT
               We'll meet again, friend.

     Boba walks toward a small panel with his blaster drawn. 
     He pushes a button on the panel and a hatch opens in the
     ceiling of the Falcon. He ignites his backpack and flies 
     out of the ship.

                            HAN 
               Well, trust a droid to get to the bottom 
               of things.

                            LUKE
               Boba sure fooled the rest of us.

59.  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

     Chewie growls as everyone enters the cockpit of the 
     Falcon. Han and Chewie take their seats.

                            THREEPIO
               I beg your pardon, sir. Chewbacca 
               suspected all along there was something 
               bad about Boba.

                            LUKE
               How did you know, Chewie?

     Chewie growls and holds his nose.

                            THREEPIO
               May I quote directly, sir? He just didn't 
               smell right.

     Everyone laughs at this.

60.  EXT. SPACE

     The Falcon flies from the planet and heads for space.

                            HAN
                    (voice over)
               Well, lets's get off this galactic 
               raindrop.

                            CAPTAIN KAZAN
                    (voice over)
               Captain Kazan, starlog 3-24-1 signing off. 
               May the force be with you.

     The cartoon ends. Lumpy applauds.

62.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     The Imperial guard and a stormtrooper tear apart Lumpy's 
     room searching for Rebel material. They throw his toys 
     and belongings all over. The guard even decides to tear 
     the head off of Lumpy's stuffed bantha doll. He then 
     tosses it to the floor.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
                    (to stormtrooper)
               Let's go.

     The two head down the staircase.

63.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     The guard and stormtrooper come down the stairs.

                            IMPERIAL GUARD
                    (to officer)
               Nothing up there.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to Lumpy)
               Go clean up your room.

     Lumpy reluctantly turns off his game and goes up to his 
     room.

64.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     Lumpy goes into his room and howls at the condition that 
     the Imperials left his room in.

65.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Malla looks upset at hearing her son's cry.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to Malla)
               That will keep him busy for a while.

66.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     Lumpy sees his bantha doll in pieces. He picks up the 
     head and hugs it to his chest. He then picks up the body 
     and carries the parts over to his bed. He lays the head 
     and body on his bed and covers them up with a blanket. He
     then starts to search his room for the cassette that came
     with the gift that Saundan brought him earlier. He finds 
     it and inserts it into the monitor in his room. The tape
     starts to play and show a man holding an assembled 
     mini-transmitter. A woman's voice begins to speak.

                            WOMAN'S VOICE
                    (over speaker)
               This product was packed under strict 
               quality control on the system Amorphia 
               and this instructional cassette provided 
               by the manufacturer. It offers a unique 
               chance for consumers everywhere to meet 
               an Amorphian being. The motor abilities 
               of Amorphian citizens are frequently 
               impaired by malfunctions which results in 
               a temporary loss of power. This in no way 
               reflects on the safety of our product, 
               rather it should serve as a guarantee of 
               our high standards of long wear and 
               durability.

     The Amorphian puts the transmitter on a table and starts 
     his instructions.

                            AMORPHIAN BEING
                    (on monitor)
               Thank you for selecting our brand of 
               mini-transmitter. If you assemble it 
               properly, following the instructions I'm 
               about to give you. It will provide
                    (slowing down)
               many years of fun and valuable services.
                    (normally)
               But, now let's get started, shall we? 
               First, find the sealed package containing 
               all the tools you'll need. Ah, it looks 
               like this. 

     The man picks up a clear zip-lock bag. Lumpy picks up 
     his, also.

                            AMORPHIAN BEING
               Try not to rip it open because it makes a 
               very handy storage case for your tools 
               until you need them again. 

     He pulls a small tool out of his bag.

                            AMORPHIAN BEING
               Now, this is the first thing you'll need. 
               Please be careful not to hurt yourself on 
               the sharp edges.

     He touches the tool's point and pulls his hand back in 
     pain.

               Ouch.

     He picks up a very small item. Lumpy looks through his 
     stuff to find his.

               Now, find the circuit breaker module and 
               by the way, let's start calling these 
               components by their proper names.
                    (slowing down)
               Circuit breaker module.
                    (normally)
               Remember, every one of the ten thousand 
               terminals on your circuit breaker module 
               is marked in a particular color. Beautiful, 
               aren't they? Like a rainbow. These must be
               connected with the wires with the 
               corresponding colors. So, red goes to red. 
               Blue goes to blue and so on. Now, watch me 
               closely.
                    (irregular speed)
               And we'll assemble our mini-transmitters 
               together. Let us work slowly and 
               methodically because this is a job worth 
               doing well.
                    (normally)
               Well, I see time is running out. So, we 
               better turn our attention to the assembly 
               of the impulse to voice translator. The 
               impulse to voice translator. The very 
               heart of the mini-transmitter which 
               converts electronic energy which provide 
               into any of a thousand
                    (slowing down)
               recognizable languages. We must remain 
               alert for this very complicated procedure.
               Endurance and concentration are the key 
               words here and the total utilization of 
               our neural cranial synapsis is absolutely
               essential.

     While the Amorphian is saying his last part of dialogue, 
     he crumples slowly to the floor until his head comes to 
     rest on the table. The cassette ends. Lumpy gets to work 
     on assembling his mini-transmitter.

67.  EXT. WOOKIEE HOME - DAY

     The camera zooms in on the second story of Chewbacca's
     family's home.

68.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME- LUMPY'S ROOM

     Lumpy is seated on the floor. He is busy at work putting
     together his mini-transmitter.

69.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     The Imperial officer and guard are talking quietly with 
     one another. The wall screen beeps and the Imperials walk
     over to see what the announcement is. The screen shows a 
     view of Tatooine from space.

                            MALE ANNOUNCER
                    (over speaker)
               The following live broadcast is 
               recommended by the Imperial council in 
               the belief that your commitment to remain
               upstanding citizens will be reinforced. 
               It is required viewing for all members of 
               the Imperial forces.

     The screen cuts to various scenes of activity in the 
     streets of Mos Eisley.

                            FEMALE ANNOUNCER
                    (over speaker)
               Time now for life on Tatooine. Brought to 
               viewers everywhere in the hope that our 
               own lives may be uplifted by the 
               comparison and enriched with the 
               gratitude of relief. This transmission is
               unrehearsed and unedited and is hereby 
               begun without further comment as to its 
               lack of moral value.

     The monitor cuts to a view inside of a cantina. There are
     dozens of bizarre aliens seated throughout. The bar's 
     patrons are being entertained by a Bith band. Tork, the 
     bar's bouncer, picks up a customer from his seat and 
     takes him out of the bar. A man walks into the bar past 
     the exiting Tork and companion. The man is Krelman and he 
     is carrying a flower in his hand. The bartender, Ackmena,
     interrupts two aliens seated at the bar who are 
     conversing.

                            ACKMENA
               Well, I'm certainly not going to get rich 
               with customers like you. I thought I 
               taught you to drink faster than that. Well, 
               at least you're steady. Oh, come on now. 
               Drink up. There's plenty more where that 
               came from.

     Krelman walks up to the bar and takes a seat. He places 
     the flower on the countertop.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to Krelman)
               What'll it be?

                            KRELMAN
               Hello, Ackmena.

                            ACKMENA
               Okay, we'll do it your way. Hello. Now, 
               we'll do it my way. What'll it be?

                            KRELMAN
               Can we talk?

                            ACKMENA
               Well of course we can talk. We are talking. 
               You're not ordering. I'm not pouring. We 
               are not drinking. We are talking. 

     Ackmena moves the flower aside that He brought.

                            ACKMENA
               I'm moving this to make room for a drink, 
               so that next time I say "what'll it be" 
               and you tell me. I can put it right there.

                            KRELMAN
               Doesn't matter. Give me anything. 

     He points to a red pitcher behind the bar. 

                            KRELMAN
               I'll have one of those. 

     Ackmena gets the pitcher and pours some of it's contents 
     into a glass in front of him.

                            KRELMAN
               I'm sorry I couldn't get back before.

                            ACKMENA
               Ah, before what?

                            KRELMAN
               Uh, until now, until tonight. I thought 
               about it a dozen times. I had to be sure.

                            ACKMENA
               Ah, excuse me. I have a customer waiting. 
               I'll be right back.

     She walks away from him.

                            KRELMAN
               "Come back soon, I'll be waiting."

     Ackmena pours a drink for an Ithorian who is seated 
     farther down the bar. Krelman pours his drink into the 
     top of his head. 

                            KRELMAN
               Ackmena?

     She hesitantly walks back over to Krelman.

                            ACKMENA
               How's your drink?

                            KRELMAN
               It's all gone. Look, there's a flower on 
               top of it.

                            ACKMENA
               I see there is. Do you want another drink?

                            KRELMAN
               The flower is for you. I wanted to bring 
               you something and that's all I could 
               think of.

                            ACKMENA
               I don't get many flowers. I uh... but you 
               didn't have to bring me anything Ah, ah...

                            KRELMAN
               Krelman.

                            ACKMENA
               Krelman, what a nice name.

                            KRELMAN
               When I left here the other night, I felt 
               something that I haven't felt in longer 
               than I care to remember. I felt alive 
               again. Someone made me feel like all the 
               years I've lived meant something. And all 
               you said was six simple words. "Come back 
               soon, I'll be waiting."

     He counts the last six words on the six fingers of his 
     left hand.

                            ACKMENA
               Well, after all, only words I probably...

     He grabs her hand in his own.

                            KRELMAN
                    (interrupting)
               ...more than words. I knew that at the 
               time. That's why I went home and thought 
               and thought about what you said.

                            ACKMENA
               Oh? What did I say?

                            KRELMAN
               It uh, it doesn't matter, silly. What you 
               said is not as important as what you meant.

                            ACKMENA
               Oh? What did I mean?

                            KRELMAN
               I decided what you meant was exactly the 
               thing I needed to hear.

                            ACKMENA
               Well, I'm glad about that.

     Ackmena walks further down the bar. Krelman gets up and
     follows her. He even goes behind the bar after her. She 
     is trying to clean behind the bar with a rag.

                            KRELMAN
               You know its funny. A man can live as 
               long as I have. Through all the ups and 
               downs and just when he thinks its all 
               over, someone cares for him again. I 
               wasn't looking for that when I came in 
               here. Maybe that's why it, it happened. 
               Because I wasn't asking for love anymore. 
               I wasn't desperate. I wasn't begging, 
               whining, ruffling, sniveling. I just came 
               in here for a drink and I find a lot more.

     He hugs Ackmena from behind. She is at a loss for words.

                            ACKMENA
               Uh, uh, Kerlman...

                            KRELMAN
               Krelman.

     She disengages herself from his embrace.

                            ACKMENA
               Uh, lis... listen uh, Krelman. You're, 
               you're kind and, and sweet and, and 
               terribly attractive but, if, if you're 
               saying what I think you're saying you
               felt you meant I thought you needed to 
               hear then, I just have one thing to say. 
               I did not.

                            KRELMAN
               Ackmena, don't do this to me...

                            ACKMENA
                    (interrupting)
               Now, please look! I have customers. 

     She motions for him to go back to the other side of the
     counter and he complies.

                            ACKMENA
               Why don't you sit down. Finish your drink. 
               Have another drink. This one's on me.

     Krelman is back in his seat. Ackmena pours a directly from
     the pitcher into the top of his head.

                            ACKMENA
               Now, you stay just as long as you want. 
               But, I have business to attend to. I 
               really have no time for anything else.

     She puts the pitcher down and walks away.

                            KRELMAN
               You'll change your mind. I just know you 
               will. Six simple words. I could wait 
               forever to hear it again because I know...

     A customer at the bar gets up and leaves. Ackmena waves
     farewell. 

                            ACKMENA
                    (to customer)
               Come back soon, I'll be waiting.

     Krelman gets upset and puts his hood over his head. He 
     then puts his head down on the table. The wall screen 
     beeps and an Imperial officer appears on it. The music 
     and conversation stops as all attention is turned to the 
     wall screen.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (on monitor)
               Due to increased activity among subversive 
               forces, we are placing a curfew on the 
               entire Tatooine system effective 
               immediately. All inhabitants will return 
               to their homes at once. This order will 
               remain in effect until further notice.

     All conversation resumes in the bar. Ackmena walks over 
     to the bandstand.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to band member)
               Okay, Bobbarine. Take a break.

     He says something back to her.

                            ACKMENA
               I don't know how long. Maybe forever. 

     The band has a fit at her answer.

                            ACKMENA
               Oh, don't leave me now. Please, please, I 
               have enough aggravation. Alright, one 
               more round before you leave. And this 
               one's on the me. 
                    (to Tork)
               Tork, see what the boys on the bandstand 
               will have.

     Tork heads over to follow her order. Ackmena goes back 
     behind the bar. She goes up to two aliens seated at the 
     bar. They are speaking to each other in an alien dialect.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to aliens)
               Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don't know how to 
               tell you this but I guess the wall screen 
               said it all. We're closed. 

     The aliens just ignore her. She raises her voice to speak 
     to everyone.

                            ACKMENA
                    (yelling)
               Gentlemen, I guess you didn't hear what I 
               said. The Empire has closed us down. Now, 
               I know this sort of thing happens all the 
               time. I... I'm sure it's just temporary, 
               fellas. The party is over.

     Some of the patrons throw things at her. She gets angry. 
     Tork comes to her aid.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to patrons)
               How dare you. You stop that.
                    (to Tork)
               Stop Tork, it's alright. I'll reason with them.

     She goes over to two more aliens seated at the bar.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to two aliens)
               Kelnor, Zutnor, come on you guys. Haven't 
               I always lent you money?

     The continue their conversation as if she wasn't there. 
     She walks over to a table where Ludlow, a Rodian is 
     seated.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to Ludlow)
               Ludlow, Ludlow, you of all creatures. 
               Please do me a favor and leave. 

     Ludlow looks down at the table and ignores her.

                            ACKMENA
               Ludlow, you're heartless. 

     She goes to another table.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to Thorp)
               Thorp, Thorp, after all I've down for you. 
               Short memory, eh, Thorp?

     He just  looks away from her.

                            ACKMENA
                    (yelling)
               Short memory!

     She goes to yet another table.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to creature, normally)
               Helpmus, do you remember the time that... 

     She realizes that the creature she is talking to is not
     Helpmus.

                            ACKMENA
               I don't believe we've met.

     Two aliens enter the bar. Ackmena walks over to them.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to aliens)
               We're closed! I said, we're closed. Look, 
               I'm sorry we are closed. The Empire just 
               imposed a curfew on this planet. Everybody 
               has to leave right now. Now... 

     One of the aliens pulls a blaster on her. Tork comes to
     her aid. She stops him.

                            ACKMENA
                    (to Tork)
               Tork, I don't want anymore trouble. You, 
               take care of the door.

     The two aliens go into the bar and take a seat. The crowd
     begins to pound their empty glasses on the tables.
 
                            ACKMENA
               Alright, alright, alright, alright. I can 
               take a hint. We'll have one more round. 
               This one's on the house. 

     They crows stop banging the tables and cheer her. She 
     heads back behind the bar. The band starts to play again.

                            ACKMENA
                    (under her breath)
               I'll run a tab for the Empire.

     Ackmena pours a drink and begins to sing. Drinks are 
     poured for everyone.

                            ACKMENA
                    (singing)
               Just one more round, friend. Then homeward 
               bound, friend. Don't forget me in your 
               dreams. Just one more song, friend. The 
               night's get shorter it seems. Just one 
               more rhyme, friend. Yes, it's a crime, 
               friend. But you know time, friend. Time 
               can fly. 

     Some of the creatures get up and leave. Ackmena waves to
     them.

                            ACKMENA
                    (still singing)
               So it's goodnight, friend. Goodnight, but 
               not goodbye. Just one more drop, friend. 
               Before we stop, friend. One more moment 
               face to face. Next time you're dry, friend. 
               Try stopping by, friend. If there's a 
               light in the place. We may not cry, friend. 
               But we survive, friend. Look, we're alive, 
               friend. You and I. 

     Some more creatures leave the cantina.

                            ACKMENA
                    (still singing)
               So say goodnight, friend. Goodnight, but 
               not goodbye. 

     An alien comes up to her and pulls her to the dance floor.
     She begins to dance with him.

                            ACKMENA
                    (still singing)
               Just one more dance, friend. Just one more 
               chance, friend. One more chorus, one more 
               tune. It's not the end, friend. If you're 
               a friend, friend. Then you come back to me 
               soon. But it's too late, pal. To celebrate, 
               pal. You have to wait, pal. Don't you cry. 
               Now, it's goodnight, friend. Goodnight 
               friend. Goodnight friend. Follow me! 

     Ackmena starts a line of creatures following her, 
     swinging their glasses in the air. She leads them to the 
     door and they begin to file out. Tork takes the glasses 
     from their outstretched hands as they leave.

                            ACKMENA
                    (still singing)
               You're such a dear, friend. You know I'm 
               here, friend. Is that a tear, friend. In 
               your eye? Now, it's goodnight, friend.
               Goodnight friend. 

     The last few people have just left. Ackmena closes the 
     door.

                            ACKMENA
                    (still singing)
               Goodnight but not...

     She walks back into the bar. Krelman is standing behind 
     the counter holding his flower. He hands the flower to 
     her. The wall screen goes off. The Imperial officer's 
     comlink beeps. He takes it off of his belt and pulls out 
     the antenna. 

                            VOICE
                    (over comlink)
               Return to base. Return to base. Return to 
               base. Return to base...

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (into comlink)
               Message received and obeyed. 

     He closes the antenna and puts the comlink back on his 
     belt. He turns to his men.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to men)
               We leave at once. 

     The stormtroopers turn to go. The officer stops one of 
     them.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (to stormtrooper)
               You, stay here. There's a male missing 
               from this household and I want you to be 
               here when he returns. It's possible, he's 
               one of the Rebels we're looking for.

     The officer, guard, and stormtrooper all leave the house.
     From upstairs is heard a voice.

                            VOICE
                    (from upstairs)
               Return to base. Return to base. Return to 
               base. Return to base...

     The stormtrooper goes up the staircase to investigate.

70.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - LUMPY'S ROOM

     The stormtrooper walks up behind Lumpy who is on the 
     floor using his mini-transmitter.

                            VOICE
                    (from machine)
               Return to base. Return to base. Return to 
               base. Return to base...

     Lumpy turns around and sees the stormtrooper. He picks up 
     the machine and backs up against the wall. The 
     stormtrooper approaches a terrified Lumpy. He roughly 
     grabs the machine from Lumpy's hands and throws it to the
     floor. It breaks into pieces. Lumpy runs past him and 
     goes downstairs. The stormtrooper follows.

71.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Lumpy runs down the stairs and out the door closely 
     followed by the stormtrooper. 

72.  EXT. WOOKIEE HOME - PORCH - DAY

     Lumpy runs out the door. The stormtrooper stops in the
     doorway with his blaster aimed at Lumpy. Chewie is 
     standing to one side of the stormtrooper. He starts to 
     take his bowcaster form his shoulder but stops because of 
     his son's danger. The stormtrooper motions with his 
     blaster for him to go over by Lumpy. Han sneaks up behind 
     the stormtrooper and knocks the blaster out of his hand. 
     Han makes a move to grab the fallen blaster and so does 
     the stormtrooper. The stormtrooper trips over some wood 
     on the porch and trips. He breaks thru the railing and 
     falls to his death. Han barely catches his balance and 
     saves himself from the same fate.

                            HAN
                    (to Lumpy)
               Lumpy, are there any more inside? Come 
               here sweetheart. 

     Han picks up Lumpy in his arms.

                            HAN
               It's okay. It's alright now. Everything's 
               okay now. Here's your daddy. 

     Han hands Lumpy over to Chewie's waiting arms

                            HAN
                    (to Chewie)
               Boy, has he grown. 

73.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Han enters the home.

                            HAN
               It's okay everybody. He's gone. 

     Chewie and Lumpy come in the door. Chewie leaves his
     bowcaster on the floor by the door. Han goes up to Malla 
     and hugs her.

                            HAN
                    (to Malla)
               How are ya? Malla! Ha,ha! 
                    (to Itchy)
               Itchy, you look wonderful. Doing well, 
               huh? Your son's been doin' you proud. 
               He's saved my tail more'n a couple of 
               times. 

     Malla growls something to Han.

                            HAN
                    (to Malla)
               Look Malla, I'd love to but, I can't. I 
               gotta get back to the Falcon before 
               somebody stumbles across her. 

     Lumpy runs up to Han and hugs his leg.

                            HAN
               Hey, will you look at Lumpy? He's sure 
               grown, huh? 

     Han kneels down in front of Lumpy.

                            HAN
               An' I think his voice is changin'. 

     Lumpy lowers his head in embarrassment.

                            HAN
                    (to Lumpy)
               Come on, I'm just teasin' ya. Well, look. 

     Han stands up and faces Malla.
     
                            HAN
                    (to Malla)
               I gotta go. Have a nice Life Day. But be 
               careful, a lotta troopers in the area. 
                    (to Chewie)
               Chewie, check and see if the coast is 
               clear, will ya? 
                    (to everyone)
               You're like a family to me. 

     Chewie looks out the door and growls back at Han.

                            HAN
               I know, bye.

     Han turns and walks toward the door.

                            HAN
                    (to Chewie) 
               Okay pal? 

     Chewie growls. Han turns back to the wookiee family and
     waves.

                            HAN
               Bye everybody.

     Han and chewie turn and walk through the door. 

74.  EXT. WOOKIEE HOME - PORCH - DAY

     Han and Chewie embrace.

                            HAN
               Well pal, be careful. 

     Hans sees the stormtrooper's blaster on the ground. He 
     picks it up and tosses it off of the porch.

                            HAN
               They'll be lookin' for him. Take care.

     Han leaves. Chewie goes back inside his home.

75.  INT. WOOKIEE HOME - MAIN LIVING AREA

     Chewie closes the door and picks up his bowcaster. He and
     Malla exchange howls. He places his bowcaster on the wood
     pile next to their fireplace and hugs his father. He then
     hugs Malla. They are interrupted by a knock at the door.
     Chewie grabs his bowcaster and opens the door. Saundan 
     enters the home to a bowcaster aimed at him.
 
                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Chewie)
               You sure know how to make a guy feel 
               welcome. 

     Chewie lowers his weapon and shakes Saundan's hand.

                            SAUNDAN
               Glad you're home, Chewbacca. 

     Lumpy runs up to the closed door and tries to look outside.

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to Lumpy)
               If you're looking for who I'm thinking 
               you're looking for, forget him. We won't 
               be bothered by him again.

     The wall screen goes on and an Imperial officer appears.
     Saundan and the wookiees watch in silence.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (on monitor)
               This is a general alert. Calling officer 
               B-4711, officer B-4711. We are unable to 
               reach you on your comlink. Is there a 
               problem? You are instructed to turn on 
               your comlink immediately.

     The wookiees are disturbed by the announcement.

                            SAUNDAN
               Wait, wait a minute. I think I can handle 
               this.

     Saundan pulls out his identification card and inserts it 
     into the wall screen's controls. He pushes some buttons 
     and the screen comes to life. The Imperial officer is 
     again on the screen.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
               We have two-way communication, trader 
               Saundan. Is this a report about the 
               missing trooper?

                            SAUNDAN
                    (to officer)
               It is, sir. Trooper B-4711 was here with 
               three other men. They left and he 
               remained. As soon as they had gone, he 
               packed a lot of food from this house and 
               robbed me blind. Then, he took off for 
               the hills.

                            IMPERIAL OFFICER
                    (taking a deep breath)
               Very well. We'll send out a search party.

                            SAUNDAN
               Thank you.

     The call ends. Saundan pushes some buttons and removes his
     card. He puts it back into his leather case.

                            SAUNDAN
               Yes, sir. Identification is very important. 
               Helps you maintain contact with the Empire 
               at times like this. 

     The wookiees growl at him. Chewbacca shakes his hand.

                            SAUNDAN
               Lumpy. Itchy. Chewie. Malla. This day is 
               for you. Have a wonderful celebration. 

     Lumpy goes to Saundan and hugs his leg.

                            SAUNDAN
               And may the force be with you.

     Saundan turns and leaves the wookiee home. The wookiees 
     all go to a shelf and get glass globes that have 
     something gold in them. The lights dim in the room as the
     wookiees gather together. They are lit by an increasingly
     bright shimmering light. They raise the globes into the 
     air.

76.  EXT. SPACE

     The wookiee family are standing in front of a starfield. 
     They are in red robes and are still holding their glass
     globes. The scene cuts to a procession of wookiees 
     heading into a bright light in the stars.

77.  INT. WOOKIEE CEREMONY HALL

     Dozens of wookiees in red robes are gathered together. 
     They each have one of the glass globes. Artoo and 
     Threepio are on a raised platform at the end of the 
     hall. The two go over to Chewbacca who is also on the
     platform.

                            THREEPIO
                    (to Chewie)
               Happy Life Day. 
                    (to assembly)
               Happy Life Day, everyone. And, we're 
               certainly glad that we were allowed to 
               celebrate it.

     Artoo whistles.

                            THREEPIO
               Yes, Artoo.

     Artoo whistle to Threepio.

                            THREEPIO
               It is indeed true, that at times like 
               this, Artoo and I wish that we were more 
               than just mechanical beings...

     Artoo whistles again.

                            THREEPIO
               ... and were really alive, so that we 
               could share your feelings with you.

     Luke, Han, and Leia all come out onto the platform. Leia 
     runs to Chewie and hugs him.

                            LUKE
               Chewbacca!

     Chewie growls and shakes Luke's hand.

                            LUKE
               Chewbacca, we were so relieved to hear 
               you were alright.

     Chewie growls.

                            HAN
                    (to Chewie)
               All of you are an important part of my 
               life, pal. I'm glad I could be here.

                            LEIA
                    (to assembly)
               This holiday is yours but, we all share 
               with you the hope that this day brings us 
               closer to freedom, and to harmony, and to 
               peace. No matter how different we appear, 
               we're all the same in our struggle against 
               the powers of evil and darkness. I hope 
               that this day will always be a day of joy 
               in which we can reconfirm our dedication 
               and our courage. And more than anything 
               else, our love for one another. This is 
               the promise of the Tree of Life.

     A slow version of the theme to "Star Wars" begins to play.

                            LEIA
                    (singing)
               We celebrate a day of peace. A day of 
               harmony. A day of joy we can all share 
               together joyously. A day that takes us 
               through the darkness. A day that leads us 
               into might. A day that makes us want to 
               celebrate the light. A day that brings the 
               promise that one day, we'll be free to 
               live, to laugh, to dream, to grow, to 
               trust, to love, to be.

     When the song ends, all the wookiees in the hall walk 
     onto the platform past our heroes. A close-up of Chewie 
     is shown. He has a flashback of scenes from events in 
     the movie.
